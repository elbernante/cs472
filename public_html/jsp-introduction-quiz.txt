JSP pages are transformed to servlets.


3. How are JSP pages related to HTML?

JSP pages are HTML with a little bit of Java mixed in.

JSP scriplet:
-------------
<% String greeting = "Hello World"; %>

int i = 100;


i is declared as instance variable.

9. Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.

EL expression is evaluated systematically in the following order:
1. page scope
2. request scope
3. session scope
4. application scope

If the expression is not found in the lower scope, the container searches for it in the next higher scope. If it can't be found anywhere, then it is ignored.


10. Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.

Servlets set the attributes in a particular scopes. The servlet then dispatch the request to a JSP, from which EL expressions are evaluated based on the attributes that were set by the servlet.


11. Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact.

Servlets handles the business logic and set attributes. After which, it forwards the request using a request dispatch to JSP.
