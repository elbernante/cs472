Introduction to Servlets Quiz


1. What is the difference between a web server and a web container?

A web server serves static contents while web container is a helper application
that extends the capabilities of a web server to serve dynamic contents.


2. What is a servlet?

A servlet is a server-side java code that can handle HTTP requests and return
dynamic content. It is a Java class that extends the capabilities of servers
that host applications access by means of a request-response programming model.


3. How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?

- Servers that support servlets have as a helper app a servlet container.
- When a request comes to the web server, if the server sees the request is for 
  a servlet, it passes the request data to the servlet container.
- The servlet container locates the servlet, creates request and response
  objects and passes them to the servlet, and returns to the web server the
  response stream that the servlet produces.
- The web server sends the response back to the client browser to be rendered.


4. Who creates request objects?

Servlet container


5. What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?

- Load
- Create
- Init
- Service
- Destroy


6. Who calls init and when?

Servlet container calls init() metod of a servlet. It is called after a servlet
is instantiated and must be completed before the container can call a service()
method.


7. Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?

doGet


8. In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?

There is only 1 instance for each servlet, but a new thread is created for every
request where a servlet's service() method is called on.


9. What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?

The servlet instance variables may be modified by concurrent threads form
several requests and therefore may have side effects to other requests.
